    "\n",
    "    Data science is the interdisciplinary field that uses various processes and practices in order to extract knowledge from different data sets. Data science is important in the Air Force for being able to take big data sets of inputs from our users and buyers then being able to analyze that data and get the crucial pieces of knowledge out of that data. Another example is the same principles apply in the acquisitions for when we have systems fail or that keep having deficiencies, you can analyze that data set of failures and find out more knowledge about what is causing the issues.\n",

    "    In an observational study, the person running the study is simply watching the participants. An observational study is all about not changing the environment or introducting any stimuli into the study. In an experiment, there would be at least two groups of people, one being the control, and one being where a singular variable is changed in order to see th effects of this variable on the given sample of participants."
